# Breast-Cancer-using-Explainable-AI
Deep learning has shown momentous accuracy in examining pictures for cancer detection. Nonetheless, a critical issue is that these models are black-box algorithms consequently they are naturally unexplainable. This makes a hindrance for clinical execution because of the absence of trust and straightforwardness that is an attribute of BlackBox algorithms. we can mitigate these concerns by providing after-the-fact explanations.
We used a CNN approach for the breast cancer dataset. The aim is to enlighten professionals on the understandability and interpretability of reasonable AI frameworks utilizing a selection of methods accessible which can be exceptionally invaluable in the medical care space. Our paper clarifies how logic methods ought to be liked to make reliability while utilizing AI frameworks in medical services.
